### Hi there 👋

# About me 🙈
==========
My name is Gilcemir, currently living in the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil. 
I'm a Junior Developer looking for something new to learn each and every day.
I love mathematics, solving problems and coding challenges!

## What I did in the past? ❓
----------------------------
- 🎓 Graduated in Computer Science at [Universidade Federal de Viçosa](www.ufv.br) (2009-2014) 📓
- 👷 Worked as developer for 4 months (04/2015 ~ 08/2015) 
- 😰 Left my job for a non-related career

## What I'm doing now? 💥
-------------------------
Well... at the same job but looking to get back!😉

### To fullfill my destiny, I'm studying:
- 💻 A lot of OOP and Functional paradigm 
- 📃 Data Structure, mainly trough leetCode (and just to be honest, I'm in love with this website 💛)
- 💿 Coding challenges: leetCode, Codewars and ProjectEuler

## My plans to the future...
Here we have to divide in three sections, at least!
We have to set short, medium and long-term goals...
If you're interested, let me know!
So...

## Where can you find me? 📫
